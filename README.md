# UE4-ZombieFactory

Welcome to the ZombieFactory project introduction.This game is a horror game and the player need to find a way to survive from the factory which is filled with zombies. I made this game with a group in my university. This game was finished when I totally unfamiliar with this game. For this reason, I didn't use some natural and also interval function to finish the development. I realised that I can use the 'Behavior Tree' to construct the enemies' AI. However, I failed to build a 'State Machine' to control the enemy characters. As a result, the enemy characters may move or act in a unnatural way.

Anyway, I believe this game is remarkable in creating a panic and depressing atmosphere for the player, so people may get something from it.

All the materials and resourses are get from the web. I will never use this project for commercial purpose and I hope this game can only be used in learing/studying purpose.

The language is Chinese, spare my poor English please.
